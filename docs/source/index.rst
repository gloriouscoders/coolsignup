What is coolsignup?
===================

*coolsignup* is a user registration, login and authentication component that you can use from any language thanks to its REST-like API. It deals with all the boring tasks like, confirming users' email addresses, resetting their passwords, and of course, login in and login out.

*coolsignup* is completely decoupled from any language or framework: you can implement part of your website in Python, another part in Javascript and yet another component in Java for example, and use the same authentication API for your users.
