   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

What is coolsignup?
===================

*coolsignup* is a user registration, login and authentication component that you can use from any language thanks to its REST-like API. It deals with all the boring tasks like, confirming users' email addresses, resetting their passwords, and of course, login in and login out.

*coolsignup* is completely decoupled from any language or framework: you can implement part of your website in Python, another part in Javascript and yet another component in Java for example, and use the same authentication API for your users.

Status of the project
=====================

The documentation of the API was written but there's no implementation yet.

I plan to implement the project but I have other priorities at the moment.
If you'd like to implement it, or fund its development, submit an issue at https://github.com/gloriouscoders/coolsignup or send me an email.
